                    <h2>Welcome to DreamPath Foundation</h2>
                    <p>At DreamPath Foundation, we believe that every child deserves the freedom to choose their own future — not one dictated by societal pressure or outdated expectations. We are here to support, guide, and empower children to explore who they truly want to become.</p>
                    <p>Whether it’s art, sports, business, music, design, or anything beyond the “engineer/doctor” mold — this is where dreams are taken seriously.</p>

            <h2>What is DreamPath Foundation About?</h2>
            <p>DreamPath Foundation is a youth empowerment NGO focused on breaking the stereotype that every child must follow a fixed career path. We educate parents, guide children through career discovery, and offer mentorship across diverse fields. We also provide free resources, skill-building workshops, and real-world exposure to help kids chase what truly excites them — not what society expects.</p>

                    <h2>Who Started It & The Vision</h2>
                    <p>DreamPath Foundation was founded by Sahil Kumar, a passionate believer in individuality, creativity, and personal freedom. Having witnessed the pressure children face to conform to predefined career paths, he created this platform to give young minds the space and support to dream differently.</p>

                    <p>Our Vision is a future where every child in India is free to explore their potential and is supported by parents, educators, and society in pursuing their true calling — without fear, pressure, or judgment.</p>
