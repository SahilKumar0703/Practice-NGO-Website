This project is just for practice.
DreamPath Foundation is a youth-focused NGO project aimed at empowering children to pursue careers based on passion, not pressure. This initiative breaks the traditional stereotype that every child must become an engineer or doctor by educating parents, offering career guidance, and supporting diverse talents in fields like arts, sports, entrepreneurship, and design.
