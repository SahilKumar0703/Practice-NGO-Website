            <h2>About DreamPath Foundation</h2>
            <p>We are a youth-centric NGO committed to breaking the societal stereotype that every child must become an engineer or doctor. Our mission is to help children discover and pursue careers aligned with their true interests—whether in arts, sports, entrepreneurship, design, or technology.</p>
            <p>We conduct awareness programs for parents, provide career guidance, and connect students with mentors from diverse fields. Alongside this, we offer free resources, workshops, and learning materials to help children take confident steps toward their dream careers.</p>
            <p>We believe in passion over pressure — and in every child’s right to choose their own future.</p>
